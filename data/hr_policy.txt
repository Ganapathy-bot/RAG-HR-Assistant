Employee Leave, Work-from-Home, and Working Hours Policy
1. Casual Leave Policy

Casual Leave (CL) is provided to employees to attend to personal matters, unforeseen circumstances, or short-term obligations that require time away from work. The organization recognizes that employees may occasionally need time off for reasons that cannot be planned well in advance, and casual leave is designed to support employee well-being while maintaining workplace efficiency.

Each employee is entitled to 12 days of casual leave per calendar year. This entitlement applies to all full-time employees who have completed their probationary period, unless otherwise specified in their appointment terms. Casual leave is credited on an annual basis and may be availed either as single days or in multiple instances, depending on the employee’s requirements and workload considerations.

Casual leave must generally be applied for in advance through the prescribed leave management system or by formally informing the reporting manager. In situations involving emergencies or unexpected events, employees are expected to notify their manager as soon as reasonably possible. Approval of casual leave is subject to managerial discretion, operational requirements, and adequate staffing levels within the department.

Casual leave is intended for short durations and should not typically be combined with other forms of leave to create extended absences, unless explicitly approved. Unused casual leave at the end of the calendar year will not be carried forward or encashed, as it is meant solely for short-term personal needs within the given year. Misuse or habitual last-minute leave without valid justification may result in review and corrective action as per organizational policy.

2. Work From Home (WFH) Policy

The organization supports flexible work arrangements that enhance productivity, work–life balance, and employee satisfaction, while ensuring that business continuity and performance standards are maintained. As part of this initiative, employees are permitted to work from home for a limited duration each week.

Employees may work from home up to two (2) days per week, subject to prior approval from their reporting manager. This flexibility is not an automatic entitlement and is granted based on the nature of the employee’s role, performance history, team requirements, and project deadlines. Certain roles that require on-site presence, direct supervision, or access to physical infrastructure may not be eligible for work-from-home arrangements.

Requests for work from home should be communicated in advance, clearly specifying the dates and ensuring that work responsibilities, meetings, and deadlines will be met without disruption. While working remotely, employees are expected to remain fully available during official working hours, respond promptly to emails and calls, and participate in virtual meetings as required.

Employees working from home must ensure a secure and professional work environment, maintain confidentiality of organizational data, and adhere to all IT and information security policies. Any misuse of the work-from-home privilege, decline in productivity, or failure to meet performance expectations may result in withdrawal of this facility.

Management reserves the right to modify, suspend, or revoke work-from-home privileges at any time based on organizational needs, compliance issues, or changes in business strategy.

3. Office Working Hours Policy

The organization follows standardized working hours to ensure consistency, collaboration, and effective communication across teams. The official office working hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday, excluding declared holidays.

Employees are expected to be present and actively engaged during these working hours, whether working from the office or from home. Punctuality and regular attendance are considered essential professional responsibilities. Any deviation from the prescribed working hours, such as late arrivals or early departures, should be communicated to and approved by the reporting manager in advance.

The standard working hours include a reasonable break for lunch, the timing of which may vary by department but should not disrupt work commitments. Employees are encouraged to manage their time efficiently to meet performance expectations while maintaining a healthy work rhythm.

In certain cases, business requirements may necessitate extended working hours, shift work, or flexible schedules. Such arrangements will be communicated in advance and managed in accordance with applicable labor laws and organizational policies. Repeated non-compliance with working hour requirements may be subject to review and disciplinary action.

4. Policy Compliance and Review

All employees are required to adhere strictly to the above policies. These guidelines are designed to balance employee flexibility with organizational accountability and productivity. Any clarification, exception, or grievance related to leave, work-from-home, or working hours should be addressed through the Human Resources department or the appropriate reporting authority.

The organization reserves the right to revise or update these policies from time to time in line with operational needs, statutory requirements, and best practices. Employees will be duly informed of any such changes.
